Bruno Schultz Books
The Street of Crocodiles – In the Polish city of Drogobych is a street of memories and
dreams where recollections of the eerie side of Schultz’s merchant family's life are
evoked in a startling blend of the real and the fantastic.
The Sanatorium under the Sign of the Hourglass – Weaving myth, fantasy, and reality,
is, to quote Schulz, "an attempt at eliciting the history of a certain family… by a search
for the mythical, the essential core of that history."
Fictions of Bruno Schulz – The stories in these pages comprise all the surviving fiction of
a man described by John Updike in the introduction as 'one of the great transmogrifiers
of the world into words'.
The Cinnamon Shops and Other Stories – In The Cinnamon Shops and Other Stories,
Bruno Schulz describes in fantastical, mythologised terms the cloth merchant's shop
where he grew up and the bizarre antics of his father.
